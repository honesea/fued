# svelte-fued

Svelte-fued is fun daily game where you have to guess most picked answers by the community.

1. You'll enter the app and be asked a question e.g 'What is the best planet'
2. You'll select an answer and be taken to a new question e.g 'What is the fluffiest animal'
3. You'll have the three guesses to put the answers in order from most popular to least popular
4. The order of answers will be decided by the community a few days before
5. You can share how you did on the ordering with a wordle like emoji breakdown
